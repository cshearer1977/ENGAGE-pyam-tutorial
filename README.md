## Overview

<img src="./_static/ENGAGE.png" height="100" align="right" alt="ENGAGE logo" />

This repository holds a [Jupyter notebook](tutorial-notebook.ipynb) for a live-demo
of the **pyam** package given as part of
the *Capacity building workshop on good practices in modeling* on February 1, 2022.
This workshop was organized as part of the Horizon 2020 project ENGAGE
([link](https://www.engage-climate.org/capacity-building-workshop-1-february-2022/)).

The Jupyter notebook is based on the advanced assignment
of the [Modelling Lab](https://github.com/danielhuppmann/climate-risks-academy-2021),
which was part of the *Climate Risks Academy 2021* organized by
the European University Institute (EUI) Florence School of Banking and Finance
in cooperation with Oliver Wyman.

The scenario data used in this tutorial notebook is taken from
the [NGFS Scenario Explorer hosted by IIASA](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs),
Phase 2 (June 2021).

The slides for the related presentation are available
at [pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/17783/](https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/17783/).

## The pyam package

<img src="./_static/pyam-logo.png" width="133" height="100" align="right" alt="pyam logo" />

This exercise uses the Python package **pyam**, an open-source community toolbox for
analysis & visualization of scenario data.
The package was developed to facilitate working with timeseries scenario data
conforming to the format developed by the
[Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC)](https://www.iamconsortium.org).
The package is used in ongoing assessments by the IPCC and in many model comparison
projects at the global and national level, including several Horizon 2020 projects.
